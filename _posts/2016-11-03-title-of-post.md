Watching haters wonder why Gambino got the game locked <br>
Half-Thai thickie, all she wanna do is Bangkok <br>
Got her hair done, French braids, now she A$AP<br>
Bino so insensitive, she asking, "Why you say that?!"<br>

I'm chilling, real nigga feeling<br>
Rich kid, asshole: paint me as a villain<br>
Still spitting that cash flow: DJ Khaled<br>
I got a penthouse on both coasts: pH balance<br>
Real nigga, I rep those, why though? Cause I said so<br>
Hip deep in the Pepto, I got five on her like Ben Folds<br>
I got more tail than that PetCo<br>
You faker than some Sweet'N Low<br>
Yeah, you got some silverware<br>
But really are you eating though?<br>
Are you eating though? Nigga, are you eating though?<br>
Breakfast, lunch and dinner's for beginners<br>
You ain't even know<br>
Never catching cases, why they faces look so E-M-O?<br>
Watch a hater hate me, wanna play me like a piano<br>
My architect know Japanese, yo' girl, she jocking these<br>
No hands like soccer teams and y'all fuck boys like Socrates<br>
You niggas ain't copping these, niggas ain't looking like me<br>
Nah, I ain't checking I.D. but I bounce 'em with no problem<br>
Tell 'em, Problem (Problem!)<br>


[Bridge: Childish Gambino]<br>
I'm winnin', yeah, yeah, I'm winnin' (What?)<br>
I'm winnin', yeah, yeah, I'm winnin' (What?)<br>
I'm winnin', yeah, yeah, I'm winnin' (What?)<br>
Rich kid, asshole, paint me as a villain<br>

[Hook: Problem]<br>
Whaaat?<br>
Don't be mad cause I'm doing me better than you doing you<br>
Don't be mad cause I'm doing me better than you doing you<br>
Don't be mad cause I'm doing me better than you doing you<br>
Better than you doing you, fuck it, what you gon' do?<br>

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]<br>
Different color, my passport, Instagram my stack load<br>
Hashtag my day wear and your girl drink my day care<br>
And I'm born rich, life ain't fair (silver spoon coon, ho)<br>
Ain't nobody sicker and my Fisker, "vroom, vroom," ho<br>
Ain't nobodyâ€”<br>
Fiskers don't make noise when they start up...<br>
Just so you know<br>
Top of the Hold 'em totem, rich forever<br>
A million was not the quota<br>
My father owned half the MoMA and did it with no diploma<br>
Year off, got no rules, tripping off of them toadstools<br>
More green than my Whole Foods<br>
And I'm too fly: Jeff Goldblum<br>
Got a glass house in the Palisades, that a-k-a<br>
White hood, white hood, (okay-kay-kay)<br>
Furniture custom, you shop at IKEA<br>
So Maserati, you whipping a Kia<br>
Spending this money, it's longer than Nia<br>
Live like a Coppola, me and Sofia<br>
Waking up broke, man, wouldn't wanna be ya<br>
Friends with the dope man, help a nigga re-up<br>
Bring a girlfriend, man, trouble when I see her<br>
"Err-eh-err-eh": onomatopoeia<br>
Oh, I got my cool on! (Tailormade!)<br>
I'm winning so they had to dump the Gatorade<br>
And I don't give a fuck about my family name<br>
